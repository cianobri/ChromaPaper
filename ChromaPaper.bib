	abstract = {Music information retrieval ({MIR)} is an emerging research area that receives growing attention from both the research community and music industry. It addresses the problem of querying and retrieving certain types of music from large music data set. Classification is a fundamental problem in {MIR.} Many tasks in {MIR} can be naturally cast in a classification setting, such as genre classification, mood classification, artist recognition, instrument recognition, etc. Music annotation, a new research area in {MIR} that has attracted much attention in recent years, is also a classification problem in the general sense. Due to the importance of music classification in {MIR} research, rapid development of new methods, and lack of review papers on recent progress of the field, we provide a comprehensive review on audio-based classification in this paper and systematically summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for music classification. Specifically, we have stressed the difference in the features and the types of classifiers used for different classification tasks. This survey emphasizes on recent development of the techniques and discusses several open issues for future research.},

	abstract = {We present a method to extract a description of the tonal aspects of music from polyphonic audio signals. We define this tonal description using different levels of abstraction, differentiating between low-level signal descriptors and high-level textual labels. We also establish different temporal scales for description, defining some features as being attached to a certain time instant, and other global descriptors as related to a wider segment. The description is validated by estimating the key of a piece. We also propose the description as a tonal representation of the polyphonic audio signal to measure tonal similarity between audio excerpts and to establish the tonal structure of a musical piece.},
